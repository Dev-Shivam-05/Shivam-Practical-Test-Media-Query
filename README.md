# 🧪 Shivam Practical Test – Responsive Layout Using Media Queries 📱

Welcome to my **Media Query Practical Test Project**!  
This project showcases my ability to build **responsive, cross-device web layouts** using only HTML and CSS — specifically focusing on **media queries** and real-time adaptive design. 🎯

This layout is clean, professional, and tested across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop). It demonstrates my understanding of layout composition, font integration, and responsiveness.
